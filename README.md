NOTE: When using with a site created from [CD Demo](https://github.com/CU-CommunityApps/CD-demo), it's recommended to change the version constraint to exact version you're using when you get to site launch (or during development, if you prefer), so that the base theme doesn't get automatically updated with other packages.  (You can always update it "manually" by increasing the version constraint when you wish.)
