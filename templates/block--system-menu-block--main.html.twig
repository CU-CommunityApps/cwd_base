/**

 * Theme override for any menu block placement of "main" menu.
 * IRL: Only meant for cwd_*_main_menu block.
 * ðŸ’¬ This menu block is a core menu block, not a menu_block module menu block, so there's no theme hook suggestion setting to target it more specifically. Should we redo the main menu block with the menu_block module? Maybe! Not sure it's worth the trouble it would cause, but I think it's worth considering.
